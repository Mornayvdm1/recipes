\f0\fs24 \cf0 Easy Prawn & Courgette Risotto\
\
Ingredients\
\
    1\'bdl (48fl oz) chicken or fish stock\
    3tbsp olive oil\
    1 onion, chopped\
    1 clove garlic, chopped\
    2 medium courgettes, diced\
    1\'bd cups of risotto rice\
    350g (9oz) cooked, medium-sized prawns\
    1tbsp fresh, flat-leaf parsley, chopped\
    2-3tbsp cr\'e8me fraiche\
\
Method\
\
    Bring the stock to a gentle simmer in a large saucepan.\
    Add the oil to a frying pan and saut\'e9 the onion, garlic and courgettes for about 5 minutes, or until the onions are soft (but not coloured).\
    Add the rice and the onions and stir gently for 1 minute or until coated with the oil.\
    Add enough of the simmering stock to just cover the rice. Stirring frequently, allow the rice to absorb most of the stock before adding any more. Repeat the process, stirring well and adding stock as required. (If the stock runs out, continue with simmering water.) It will take 15-18 minutes to cook. Taste the rice for texture - it should be soft but still retain a little bite.\
    Remove from the heat, add the prawns and parsley, then stir in the cr\'e8me fraiche. Season to taste with salt and freshly ground pepper. Cover and allow to rest for a few minutes before serving.\
